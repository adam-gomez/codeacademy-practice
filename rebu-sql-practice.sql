/* 
You are a data analyst at REBU, a ridesharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

trips - trips information
riders - users data
cars - autonomous cars
*/

-- Letâ€™s examine the three tables.
SELECT * FROM trips;

SELECT * FROM riders;

SELECT * FROM cars;

-- What are the column names?

- date: stored in YYYY-MM-DD format
- pickup: stored in HH:MM 24 hour clock format 
- dropoff: stored in HH:MM 24 hour clock format
- rider_id: 3 digit number, matches riders.id
- car_id: 1 digit number, matches cars.id
- type: text, 'X', 'POOL', or 'XL'
- cost: number with 2 decimal places

riders:
- id: starts at 101, auto increment, primary key
- first: first name
